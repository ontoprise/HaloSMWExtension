This folder contains settings files for the wiki administration tool.

repositories: A list of repositories which should be requested. It is excluded if
                you install an update of the wiki admin tool.

               Note: This file was previously located at deployment/tools. Copy 
               it from there if necessary.
               
settings.php: This is a pre-configured template of the setting file. It must be copied 
                into the root folder of the wiki admin tool to work. On every update
                it is overwritten with the latest possible settings. The acually used
                settings.php file in the root folder is untouched!
                
externalapps:  Store paths of external applications (ie. applications which are not 
                published by the webserver). Usually non-PHP applications.
                
                The format is key=value. One per line, e.g.
                
                    tsc=c:\Programme\TSC
                    solr=c:\SMWPLUS\solr
                    
                If the external application is not listed here, it can NOT be considered
                by WAT.
                 
                Is never overwritten by an update
                
serversettings: Stores paths for server scripts which start/stop services on the server.

                Is never overwritten by an update
