Installation instructions for Wiki Administration Tool (formerly known as Deployment framework)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Install instructions for the latest version of the Wiki Administration Tool are also online:

 http://smwforum.ontoprise.com/smwforum/index.php/Help:Installing_Wiki_Administration_Tool

---------------------------------------
Important!  
---------------------------------------
The new template of settings.php file is delivered in the config folder. If you install 
the wiki admin tool for the first time, you have to copy settings.php in the root folder
(deployment/settings.php). If something is wrong the tool will tell you when you first access
it. If you update, take a look in it and check if you need to set additional parameters.

WAT 1.70:

Old restore point must be converted manually. Otherwise they can not be restored. Don't worry,
this is easy. Just zip the content of a restore point directory in a zip called software.zip. 
You can delete the files afterwards (EXCEPT: dump.sql)

#
# 1. Installation:
# =================

 Note: If you upgrade from DF 1.31 make sure that you configured:
 
        require_once('deployment/Deployment.php');
        
    This was optional before DF 1.56! (see also step 7)
    
(1) Unzip deployment-x.x.x.zip in the MediaWiki root folder.
(2) Set in LocalSettings.php the values for
 
            $wgDBadminuser and 
            $wgDBadminpassword
             
      with the name and passwort of the administrator user in
      your MYSQL installation. If you are using SMW+ then your 
      default name and passwort is: 'root' and 'm8nix'.
     
     Important: Use string constants and *not* other variables to define these variables.
      
(3) On Linux: make smwadmin.sh executable 

      Open the installation directory of the Wiki Administration Tool in the 
      commandline interface: "<mediawiki-install-dir>/deployment/tools/"
      and call: "chmod +x smwadmin.sh"
      
(4) Include the path to the php binary to PATH variable (either Windows or Linux) 
(5) Include the path to mysql.exe to the PATH variable (either Windows or Linux)
(6) Test your installation

  Open the installation directory of the Wiki Administration Tool in the 
  commandline interface in <mediawiki-install-dir>/deployment/tools/
  and call: smwadmin.bat (windows) or ./smwadmin.sh (linux). You should see the help screen.
  
(7) add the following include statement in your LocalSettings.php 
    
     require_once('deployment/Deployment.php');
 
    It enables a special page for checking the integrity of the MW installation. 
    
    Be careful: Up to DF 1.31 this step was optional. It is NOT anymmore.
    
(8) Webadmin console. !This is OPTIONAL! 
	There is a web-based version of DF called 'webadmin console'
    
    for installation instructions see deployment/tools/webadmin/INSTALL
    
#
# 1a.
#

There is a settings file located at deployment/settings.php. Take a look in it,
it is documented.
    
#    
# 2. I already have SMW installed. Can I use the DF though?
# ==========================================================

The DF requires extensions to have some metadata around. If you have SMW and/or SemanticForms
installed manually and you want to use the DF you may "lift" your installation
automatically. There is a tool called checkInstallation.php which can do that.

(the following instructions assume the "php" command lies in your PATH variable)

(1) Open a console in admin mode and change to deployment/tools/maintenance
(2) Run: php checkInstallation.php
        The tools does some checks and tell you if there are extensions to be lifted.
(2) If that is the case, run:
 
        php checkInstallation.php --lift

After that you can run smwadmin tool to see if it recognizes SMW as installed.

    deployment/tools/smwadmin -l

Note that the lifting process does only work for SMW + SF. If you have other extensions
that should be handled by the DF, you should remove them from the LocalSettings.php
and re-install them via DF. They get overwritten then!

The lifting should also work with the SemanticBundle. It is a bundle of several
semantic extensions containing SMW + SF among others.

# 3. HowTo use the Wiki Administration Tool
# ======================================

Wiki administration tool utility v1.6.0_0 [B???], Ontoprise 2009-2011

Usage: smwadmin [ -i | -d ] <bundle>[-<version>] [ additional-options ]
       smwadmin -u [ <bundle>[-<version>] ] [ additional-options ]
       smwadmin -r [ <restore point name> ]
       smwadmin [--desc ] -l [ fragment ]
       smwadmin --rcreate [ <restore point name> ]
       smwadmin --rlist
       smwadmin --finalize

        -i <bundle>: Install
        -d <bundle> ]: De-Install
        -u <bundle>: Update
        -l [ pattern ] : List installed bundles.
        --desc -l : Shows additional description about the bundles.
        -l smw : Lists only bundles containing 'smw' in the ID.
        -r [ name ]: Restore from a wiki-restore-point.
        --rcreate [ name ]: Explicitly creates a wiki-restore-point.
        --rlist : Shows all existing wiki-restore-points
        --finalize: Finalizes installation
        
        Additional options (can only be used with the optional above):
        
        --dep : Check only dependencies but do not install.
        -f: Force operation (ignore any problems if possible)
        --nocheck: Skips checks for appropriate rights.
        --noask: Skips all questions (assuming mostly 'yes' except for optional bundles
        --removereferenced: Removes all templates, images and instances referenced used by a bundle. Used with -d
                --removeTemplates: Removes all templates referenced used by a bundle. Used with -d
                --removeInstances: Removes all instances referenced used by a bundle. Used with -d
                --removeImages: Removes all images referenced used by a bundle. Used with -d
        --removestillused: Removes also pages which are used by other bundles. Used with -d --removereferenced
        --applypatches <bundle-ID>: Applies all patches of the given bundle again.

Examples:
        smwadmin -i smwhalo 
            Installs the given bundle 'smwhalo'
        smwadmin -u: 
            Updates complete installation.
        smwadmin -u --dep 
            Shows what would be updated.
        smwadmin -d smw 
            Removes the bundle 'smw'.
        smwadmin -r myrestorepoint
            Restores old installation from the restore point 'myrestorepoint'. 
        smwadmin -i smwhalo -f
            Installs smwhalo ignoring any problems.
        smwadmin -u --noask 
            Updates the complete installation with no prompting.

#
# 4. Restore wiki from restore point
# ===================================
Whenever the Wiki Administration Tool performs one the following actions,
it offers to create a "Wiki Restore Point":
* Installing a package: smwadmin -i <package>
* De-installing a package: smwadmin -d <package>
* Updating a package: smwadmin -u <package>

You may create a restore point and do an arbitrarily number of subsequent operations. You
can create as many restore points as you want.

You can create a restore point without changing the wiki by using this command:

smwadmin -rcreate [name] 

If name is missing a unique ID will be created. This can be useful if you want to 
save your wiki periodically.

Call "smwadmin -r [name]" to bring your Wiki back to a Wiki Restore Point. If name
is missing, you will be prompted which should be restored.

Simply said, the Wiki Administration Tool can undo your previous action and bring
your Wiki back to previous state (including the data, articles and
configuration).


#
# 5. Adding new repositories
# ===========================
        
File for repository links:
/deployment/config/repositories

You may add new repositories here, the Ontoprise repo is already configured.

Note: The former location of this file was in deployment/tools

#
# 6. Using Wiki Administration Tool with a Proxy
# ===========================================

Open <mediawiki-install-dir>/deployment/settings.php and set the proxy server address for
'df_proxy'. For Example: 'df_proxy' => 'proxy.example.com:8080'

#
# 7. Wiki Administration Tool log
# ================================
The DF writes a log about the operations. It is stored in $HOME/$wikiname/df_log
Both $HOME and $wikiname can be configured in <mediawiki-install-dir>/deployment/settings.php
    
The are usually two log files for each run of smwadmin. One for the installation process and
one for the initialization process.

#
# 8. Importing ontologies
# ========================
First, take a look into tools/onto2mwxml/README.TXT and install onto2mwxml (requires TSC).

Importing an ontology is as follows:

    smwadmin -i <ontology file (full path)>

#
#9. Non public apps
#===================
Apps which are not published by the webservcer (TSC, SOLR,...) are handled separately.
There is a file deployment/config/externalapps with the following format:

<ID>=<path>

Example:
tsc=d:\tsc

The file makes sure that the Wiki Administration Tool finds the applications. It is able 
to find existing installations by itself but this works only for Windows if it is properly 
registered in the Windows registry (which is the case when installed via Windows Installer). 
Linux users should configure their applications if they were not installed via the Wiki 
Administration Tool in the first place.

#
# Troubleshooting
#

Q: What means: "No HTTP impl. available on this system" ? 
A: WAT needs the socket function of PHP or the 'curl' module loaded to access files via HTTP.
   The socket functions are part of the standard PHP release but some webhosters deactivate them.
   If they are missing, WAT can use 'curl' instead. If this is also missing, WAT won't work. Sorry.
   
   Uncomment one of the following in settings.php:
   
   //'df_http_impl' => 'HttpDownloadCurlImpl',
   //'df_http_impl' => 'HttpDownloadSocketImpl',
   
Q: Does my PHP installation have all requirements installed?
A: Please run checkPHP.php on the command line or go to Special:CheckInstallation.
