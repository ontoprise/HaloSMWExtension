Installation instructions for HaloACL extension v1.0
---------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements: 
=============

    MediaWiki 1.13.2
    SMW 1.4.2 (optional)

Installation:
=============

The easiest way to install HaloACL is using the deployment framework:

 smwadmin -i haloacl

This installs the extension and patches MediaWiki and SMW.

For a manual installation, you have to copy the folder HaloACL into 
the extensions folder of MediaWiki. HaloACL will then already work, if you 
activate it in LocalSetting.php (see below). 

However, you can apply two patches:
* patch_for_MW_1.13.2.txt: 
	This patch for MediaWiki 1.13.2 removes all links to protected pages from 
	the rendered articles and listings. If a link can not be removed, it is 
	replaced by a link to the page 'Permission denied'. This patch is optional.
* patch_for_SMW_1.4.2.txt: 
	This patch for SMW 1.4.2 is mandatory, if you want to protect the values of 
	semantic properties.


Activating HaloACL
------------------

The extension is activated by adding the following lines to LocalSettings.php:

include_once('extensions/HaloACL/includes/HACL_Initialize.php');
enableHaloACL(); 


Options:
========

All configuration options are defined and described in HACL_Initialize.php.
