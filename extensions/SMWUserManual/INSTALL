Installation instructions for SMWUserManual Extension
-----------------------------------------------------

Requirements: 
=============

    MediaWiki 1.15.x
    SMWHalo 1.4.6

Installation:
=============

After unpacking the zip file in the extension directory
you should have the following structure:

/mediawiki_dir/extensions/SMWUserManual/
  +--includes
  +--languages
  +--maintenance
  +--scripts
  | +--languages
  +--skins
  
Edit your LocalSettings.php and add the following:
require_once("$IP/extensions/SMWUserManual/includes/SMW_UserManual.php");
enableSMWUserManual();

This enables the SMWUserManual in your wiki and you will see a question
mark on the right tab section (Ontoskin 3) or a help link below the tab
section on the right side (all other skins).

Before being able to see any help articles, you must import these. Go into
the maintenance directory of this extensions. There must be two files:
 SMW_setup.php
 cshPages.xml
 
Execute now the following command. This will read the articles from the
XML file and import them into your wiki:
 php SMW_setup.php -i --file=cshPages.xml


Updating the help articles:
===========================

The help articles are audited in the SMW+ Forum. We change them as new
requirements come up and features change. Also user feedback is included.
With the setup script in the maintenance directory you can always fetch
a new version of all help articles that are available. The setup script
know the following options:
 no option given: fetch all help articles from the SMW+ forum and install
                  these in your wiki.
 -d delete all help articles from your wiki
 -e fetch articles from the SMW+ forum and write them to a local xml file
 -i read a local xml file and import all help articles into your wiki
 -o overwrite must be set to overwrite existing help articles in your
    wiki with a new version. Also use this to overwrite and existing
    xml file when exporting the help articles
 --file=<filename> this is needed by the -e and -i switch, when the xml
                   file is used to export or import help articles.

Configuration for the extension:
================================

The functionality of the SMWUserManual extension can be affected by
several options that can be set as variables. These must be put in the
LocalSettings.php after the require_once statement and before the
enableSMWUserManual() function call.

A detailed description of all variables and their meaning can be found
in the file SMW_UserManual.php in the includes directory.
